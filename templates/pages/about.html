          <p>
            Lionnic generates revenue through advertising and branded content.
            It's important to note that advertisements and branded content are
            developed and sold separately from Lionnic's categories. All branded
            content is clearly labeled as such, and it's essential to understand
            that advertisements do not reflect the views of Lionnic's editorial
            staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, the editorial team may create packages, stories, and
            newsletters sponsored by advertisers. In such cases, these pieces
            are clearly marked as "sponsored by." However, please be assured
            that editorial content produced in collaboration with sponsors is
            developed in the same rigorous manner as our standard editorial
            content and adheres to the same high editorial standards.
